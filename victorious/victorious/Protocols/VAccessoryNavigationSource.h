/**
 This protocol is intended to be implemented by view controllers who are using template-driven
 navigation bar button items through the `accessoryMenuItems` property of their dependency manager.
 This is done primarily through VDependencyManager+VNavivationItem.  The methods in the
 protocol are called while navigation bar button items are being created and interacted with so
 that the view controller has a change to override, extend or inject dependencies in the default
 behavior.

 In cases where some kind of custom badging behavior for the navigation menu item is needed, objects

 used to generate and update badge values in place of the menu item's `destination`, which is
 the default provider.  This is most useful for navigation items that do not inherently have a
 destination (because they have some custom behavior that is overidden), but still want to display
 a badge to represent something about that custom behavior.

 authorization requirements as well.  This may be necessary if, for instance, there is no destination.
