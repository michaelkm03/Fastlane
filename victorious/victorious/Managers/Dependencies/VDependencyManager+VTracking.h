 @param parameters Dictionary of parameters to include with the event.
 @param tempalteClass A `Class` type that allows the view controller to specify a template class as the source
 of the view event.  Internally, this category prevents duplicate tracking events by checking that the class
 of the view controller provided to this method is actually the class that corresponds to the template component
 (such as a ".screen" component) as configured in templateClasses.plist.  If that's not the case, the event is
 not tracked under the assumption that the event was trigger by a view controller that whose dependency manager
 is inherited from another view controller that instantiated it, and therefore is not the view controller presentation
 of the template component (because it's parent is).  Anyway, the `templateClass` parameter allows the context
 to override that in situations where the template structure or some other functionality is breaking that normal usecase,
 such as is the case with navigation destinationst that provide alternate destinations.
