@interface VTimerManager : NSObject

/**
 Equivalent to NSTimer's scheduleTimerWithTimeInterval:target:selector:userInfo:repeats: function but with a weak reference to the target instead of strong reference.
 
 @param timeInterval The number of seconds between firings of the timer. If seconds is less than or equal to 0.0, this method chooses the nonnegative value of 0.1 milliseconds instead.
 @param aTarget The object to which to send the message specified by aSelector when the timer fires. The timer manager maintains a weak reference to target.
 @param aSelector The message to send to target when the internal timer fires. The selector should have one of the following signatures: timerFired, timerFired: . All other signatures are invalid and will cause an assertion failure.
 @param userInfo Custom user info for the internal timer. The internal timer maintains a strong reference to this object until the internal timer is invalidated (which occurs after the provided selector is called on the provided target). This parameter may be nil.
 @param repeats If YES, the internal timer will repeatedly reschedule itself until invalidated. If NO, the timer will be invalidated after it fires.
 
 @return A new timerManager instance containing a scheduled NSTimer and a weak reference to the supplied target.
