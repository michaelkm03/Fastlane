/**
 
 VBaseWorkspaceViewController is the container for all of the major components of editing. It's primary responsibility is to maintain the view hierarchy of three key areas:
 
 The Canvas View -The canvas view is the area where a user can preview their edits to their currently selected item. It has an ImageView which sits inside of a scrollView. The scrollView is used as an artboard and slice tool (the bounds of the scrollview represent the currently selected slice for exporting).
 The inspector View - The inspector view is where tools can add additional UI such as a picker, slider, etc.
 A toolbar - Representing the currently selected top level tool. For images these are: Text, Filters, and crop.
