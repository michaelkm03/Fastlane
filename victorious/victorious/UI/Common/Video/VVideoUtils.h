 To create clean loops, multiple AVAssets are added to a composition.
 Playback from one asset to another will be seamless, but eventually there
 will be a slight pause as the composition restarts.  This number determines
 how many assets are added to a composition, and effectively determines
 after how many loops the inevitable pause will show.  Keep it as high as
 performance allows to improve user experience.
