/**
 Protocol for an implementation of a controller object that controls the initialization,
 appearance, scroll position tracking and animation associated with floating navigation views.
 The floating view itself is provided from calling code and is designed to be a subview of
 a navigation controller which allows the child view to overlap onto the navigation view
 controller's top view controller.  Implementors can selectively hide or show the child view
 with animation based on scroll position of some arbitary scroll view in context of calling code.
