About the AppDynamics iOS SDK
==============

The AppDynamics iOS SDK is a framework that allows you to monitor the performance of an iOS application as it runs.
    It will automatically detect and instrument HTTP requests that the enclosing application sends via NSURLConnection,
    as well as any application crashes that occur. You can also call into it to instrument specific methods in your own
    code, to measure durations of operations in your application (like application start up, for example), or to report
    an arbitrary metric.

Quick install
=============

To use the AppDynamics iOS SDK with your application, follow these steps:

1. Link your project against EUMInstrumentation.framework. The easiest way to do this is to drag the
    EUMInstrumentation.framework bundle into your project's Frameworks group in Xcode.
2. Add a call to initialize the SDK when your application starts up. This looks something like:

        [ADEumInstrumentation initWithKey:@"<YOUR APP KEY HERE>"];
    
    If you don't know your app key, see the [documentation](http://docs.appdynamics.com/).

3. Link your project against the following libraries:

    - SystemConfiguration.framework
    - CoreTelephony.framework
    - libz.dylib
    - libsqlite3.dylib

Instrumenting methods
==============

While the AppDynamics iOS SDK instruments some system method automatically, you can also use it to instrument methods
    in your own code. When you do this, you'll be able to see how often the instrumented method is invoked, and how
    long it takes to run. To do this, add a call at the beginning and end of the method you'd like to instrument:
    
        - (void)startTimerWithName
        {
            id tracker = [ADEumInstrumentation beginCall:self selector:_cmd];
            
            // Implementation of method here ...
            
            [ADEumInstrumentation endCall:tracker];
        }

Timing events
==============

Sometimes you want to time an event in your application that spans multiple methods. A common example would be
    measuring how long your application takes to launch. You can do this by calling the SDK when the event starts,
    and then again when it ends. For example, timing application start might look like this:
    
        int main(int argc, char * argv[])
        {
            [ADEumInstrumentation initWithKey:@"<YOUR APP KEY HERE>"];
            [ADEumInstrumentation startTimerWithName:@"App Startup"];
            
            // ...
        }
        
        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
        {
            // ...
            [ADEumInstrumentation stopTimerWithName:@"App Startup"];
            return YES;
        }


Reporting metrics
==============

If you'd like to report some other type of data, you can use a metric. The only requirement is that the metric value
    must be an integer. Reporting a metric looks like this:
    
        [ADEumInstrumentation reportMetricWithName:@"My custom metric" value:<VALUE HERE>];
