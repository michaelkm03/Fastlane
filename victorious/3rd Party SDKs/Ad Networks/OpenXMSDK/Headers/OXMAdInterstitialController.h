 a) if your app supports just one orientation - you can set needed ad unit ID and leave the other one empty.
 
 b) in case you are using the same ad unit id for both orientation - you have to set this ad unit as both portraitAdUnitID and landscapeAdUnitID. (Note that images will be scaled down if they do not fit the current orientation, so this configuration isn't common for interstitials.)
 
 c) in case you have a different ad unit id for each orientation - set it accordingly to portraitAdUnitID and landscapeAdUnitID.
