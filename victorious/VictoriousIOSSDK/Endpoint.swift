/// This protocol defines a type that can construct an HTTP request to a Victorious API endpoint and parse
/// the JSON response into strongly-typed model objects.
///
/// - Remark:
/// You may notice that this protocol is very similar to `Request`, in that they both define HTTP requests
/// and handle responses. The purpose of this protocol is specifically to implement a Victorious API, 
/// whereas `Request` implements any HTTP request to any remote API. The catch is that only `Request`
/// implementations can be `execute()`-ed.
///
/// `Endpoint` implementations cannot be executed by themselves because they are lacking some key functionality.
/// First of all, many `Endpoint` implentations do not contain absolute URLs, only a relative URL. Secondly, 
/// the Victorious API requires an Authorization header, and `Endpoint` instances do not have enough
/// information to calculate it.
///
/// In order to execute an instance of `Endpoint`, it must first be transformed into an instance of `Request`
/// by adding these key pieces of information. To do that, please see the `EndpointRequest` struct.
